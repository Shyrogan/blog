# Welcome everyone!

Hello and welcome to my blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects with you. While I don't expect to have a large audience, I hope this blog will serve as a record of my work and interests.

## About This Blog

I built this blog using SolidJS and GitHub.  
When you visit the main page, your browser retrieves data from my GitHub repository, where I store my articles. The markdown content of each article is parsed into HTML components using [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter).  

When you click on an article, the content is fetched and displayed dynamically without refreshing the page, thanks to the power of SolidJS. 

## SolidJS <3

I recently started working with SolidJS, and I absolutely love it. It's fast, intuitive, and provides almost everything you need.  
My only regret is that I couldn't find a library to animate some of the UI components.  
I also used SolidJS to build an application for managing [ENSCM](https://www.enscm.fr/fr/) VR projects. If you're familiar with React, you'll feel right at home with SolidJS.

## My Favorite Subjects

In this blog, I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences on a few subjects that interest me:

- **Minecraft**

I've been playing Minecraft for years, and I love experimenting with mods and plugins. I'm always looking for new ways to enhance gameplay and create interesting experiences. I'll be sharing my experience and the good practices I've found when writing some of my projects.

- **The JVM and Hackery**

As a computer science student, I've spent a lot of time working with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I enjoy digging into the internals and finding creative solutions to problems. I also like tinkering with other programming languages and platforms.

- **Rust**

I've recently started exploring Rust, and I'm really impressed with its performance and safety features. I'm excited to learn more about the language and share my experiences with you.

## Conclusion

Thanks for stopping by my blog! I hope you find my writing interesting and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me on social media. Stay tuned for more articles on Minecraft, the JVM, Rust, and other topics that interest me. See you soon!
